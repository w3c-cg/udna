# Universal DID-Native Addressing (UDNA) Community Group

[![W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/src/templates/wordpress/StoryTeller/img/cglogo.png)](https://www.w3.org/community/udna/)

## Summary

The **Universal DID-Native Addressing (UDNA) Community Group** is advancing the next generation of Internet architecture through identity-native networking protocols. We are developing a comprehensive framework that treats Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as first-class network primitives, enabling secure, private, and self-sovereign digital communications at global scale.

### Mission

To explore, develop, and promote Universal DID-Native Addressing (UDNA)‚Äîa paradigm-shifting framework that makes cryptographic identity the foundational addressing mechanism for network protocols. UDNA enables identity-native communication, privacy-preserving routing, and secure self-sovereign interactions across decentralized systems, laying the foundation for a more secure, private, and equitable Internet.

### The Problem

Current Internet infrastructure suffers from fundamental architectural limitations rooted in its 1970s origins:

- **Location-based addressing**: IP addresses describe where services are, not what they are
- **Centralized trust dependencies**: DNS hierarchies and certificate authorities create single points of failure
- **Privacy by accident**: Network protocols leak metadata and enable surveillance by default
- **Bolt-on security**: Security mechanisms added as afterthoughts rather than foundational principles

### The Solution

UDNA represents a fundamental architectural shift from location-based to identity-based networking:

- **Cryptographic verifiability**: Every network endpoint is identified by a cryptographically verifiable DID
- **Global uniqueness**: No centralized coordination required for address creation
- **Privacy by design**: Pairwise and rotating identifiers prevent correlation and tracking
- **Self-sovereign control**: Individuals and organizations control their own network identities

## Scope

### Core Focus Areas

**üîê Protocol Specifications**
- DID-native network addressing formats and wire protocols
