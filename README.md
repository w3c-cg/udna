UDNA: Universal DID-Native Addressing
UDNA is a new network architecture that fundamentally re-imagines how we address, route, and authenticate network endpoints. Instead of relying on the legacy Internet's location-based addressing (IP addresses), UDNA uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as the core network primitive. This creates a secure, resilient, and privacy-centric foundation for the next generation of digital infrastructure.

Why UDNA?
The Internet's foundational protocols are a product of a simpler, more trusting era. They suffer from three core crises:

The Identity Crisis: IP addresses describe location, not identity, creating a semantic gap that requires fragile, layered solutions.

The Trust Crisis: Certificate authorities and DNS hierarchies are centralized points of failure, making the network vulnerable to compromise and censorship.

The Privacy Crisis: Location-based addressing enables mass surveillance and network-level correlation by design.

UDNA resolves these issues by making cryptographic identity the primary network primitive, enabling a truly Zero Trust Architecture from the ground up.

Key Features
Identity-as-Address: Every network endpoint is directly identified by a self-sovereign DID, eliminating the need for complex overlay systems.

Cryptographic Verifiability: All addressing and routing operations are cryptographically verifiable at the protocol level, without relying on centralized third parties.

Privacy by Default: UDNA employs Pairwise DIDs and Rotating DIDs to prevent correlation and tracking, ensuring user privacy by design.

High Performance: Designed for demanding, low-latency applications, UDNA achieves sub-50Î¼s DID resolution and <2ms handshake latency.

Decentralized Resilience: A multi-tier, distributed resolution network ensures high availability and resistance to denial-of-service attacks.

Protocol-Native Integration: UDNA is seamlessly integrated as a core component of the Sirraya Codon Protocol (SCP), a purpose-built, next-generation protocol stack.

Getting Started
UDNA is currently in active development. Our reference implementation is being built in Rust to ensure performance and security.

To get started with the project:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/SirrayaLabs/UDNA.git](https://github.com/SirrayaLabs/UDNA.git)
cd UDNA
