## Recommendations

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache Utilization**: The resolver cache was unused during testing. Implementing cache warming strategies could further improve resolution times for repeated DID lookups.

2. **Batch Operations**: The system supports batch signature verification. Implementing batch processing for DID generation could improve throughput for bulk operations.

3. **Memory Management**: The stable memory profile with periodic cleanups indicates well-designed garbage collection. Consider tuning cleanup intervals based on usage patterns.

### Monitoring Enhancements

1. **Extended Metrics**: Add CPU utilization, disk I/O, and network metrics for comprehensive performance monitoring.

2. **Load Testing**: Conduct stress testing with concurrent operations to validate scalability assumptions.

3. **Long-term Monitoring**: Extend monitoring periods to identify potential long-term performance trends.

### Security Considerations

1. **Key Generation Entropy**: Verify that the DID key generation uses cryptographically secure random number generation.

2. **Cache Security**: Implement cache invalidation strategies for security-sensitive operations.

## Conclusion

The UDNA performance demonstration reveals a highly efficient and stable system capable of:

- Rapid cryptographic operations (sub-millisecond DID generation)
